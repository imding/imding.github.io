### GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks consists of 2 components:
1. Discriminator
2. Generator

Take cat pictures as an example.

The generator would generate a 2D array of pixel data based on some arbitrary noise, the discriminator would assign a scalar value between 0 and 1 to indicate whether it thinks the data represents a total forgery of a cat image or a real photo of a cat, this rating influences how the generator generates its next cat image.

The network achieves its maximum efficiency when the generator always generates cat images that looks like real cats, and the discriminator always outputs 0.5, indicating it's 50/50 whether the cat image is fake or real. At this point, the discriminator can be discarded and the generator is kept for its ability to create realistic cat images.
