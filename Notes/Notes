### Todo List Feedback
*step 2* - asks the learner to add id names for 6 HTML elements, this is too many things to ask a learner to understand and keep in their heads, idealy they should create only one with a clear *why* and *how*, they can reference it in JS in the same step.

*step 3* - asks the learner to reference 6 HTML elements, only one of which is immediately relevant. also for all future project, please use `querySelector` instead becuase the argument used are exactly the CSS selector you would use, it's a good reinforcement model.

*step 5-6* - use `classList.add` instead.

*step 5-7* - avoid using the `this` keyword. do `var clickedButton = event.target` first and use *clickedButton*. also, rather than showing 2 big blocks of code, use an image with cirlces and notations to illustrate `*.parentNode.parentNode`.

*step 8* - merge this step with step 4 so it makes sense to mention "the clicked button" in step 5-7. also this function should be more aptly named, maybe *toggleStatus*.

*step 9* - the conditional should be the first thing learners do after creating the `clickedButton` variable. also the check can be much simpler, i.e. `if (clickedButton.textContent == 'Done') {}`.

*step 10-11* - comments above apply

*step 13* - use `querySelectorAll`
