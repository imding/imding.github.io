# Career Growth Discussion

## Key Achievements in 2023

Initially tasked with familiarising myself with the PESS2 project and handling feature development, I exceeded expectations with:
- **[Aug ~ Nov]** Despite being the newest member of a 5-developer team, I singularly identified critical technical debt issues and successfully brought these concerns to team awareness through persistent communication
- **[Dec]** Architecting and prototyping a solution for the PESS2 system revamp, collaborating with the team to refine the implementation

- **Maintained development velocity despite team size reduction** through efficient process optimisation
- Fostered **team growth** through strategic **task delegation** and **personalised guidance**
- Offer insights to better enact efficient **project management** relating to planning, tracking, review, risk handling, customer liaison, decision making, etc...

## Strategic Vision for 2025

As the time approaches the 12th month mark since my promotion, several ideas have been brewing and I would like to present them here:
- **Unified Teck Stack** I would like to explore the possibility of taking the lead on researching and implementing a cross-team technology stack. Rationales are as follows:
    - I have observed huge amounts of redundant work just within the PESS2 project, where the same logical unit is implemented multiple times in various places. This incurs a significant financial cost as revamping the PESS2 has hopefully demonstrated that a much smaller team can produce a much higher quality outcome given a well designed and architectured framework.
    - Having a well maintained and modern stack makes hiring and training new recruits easier.
    - Cross-team transfer of existing members will be low-friction because they are already familiar with the framework.
    - Rising tide lifts all boats, all projects will enjoy efficiency gains when the framework is improved.
- **AI Initiatives** As a component of the unified tech stack, or standalone, I would love to make a measurable impact on adding AI capabilities into the development cycle at a relatively low level, i.e. not low-code/no-code bundles of models. My basis is:
    - The world is moving very quickly towards having AI technologies embedded at every level, and my current engagement with it professionally (by extension of the company as well) is very weak.
    - We already seem to have an AI initiative and I have already contributed to the initial research.
    - The development environment is a great incubation chamber to develop AI capabilities that can potentially become valuable externally.
- **Robust Testing** The system failure in 2024 has clearly indicated that manual testing is insufficient, even under insane work hours imposed upon the QA members. With the help of Fan and potentially future recruits, I would like to implement a robust testing framework that offers us confidence in the systems we develop and in turn gain higher levels of trust with our customers.
